    "chatter": "A wet winter brought to light problems at the nation’s tallest dam, which controls water delivered across the state. As storms raged in early February, dam operators released heavy flows down the Feather River, but a crisis began when a crater opened on the main spillway. Days later, water poured over an emergency spillway – essentially a hillside – that had never been used. The erosion of the hillside prompted the evacuation of nearly 200,000 people downstream."

Most reservoirs in California are similarly at or near capacity and are releasing large amounts of water downstream."
